# setTemplate
setTemplate function allow you to set your html from another html file.

All script tags inside your template are evaluated as function so every script is scoped. That allows you to use ```const```, ```let``` or ```function``` inside script tag which does not affect another file template.

Its so lightweight library that can be used with any other library such as React.js, jQuery and so on...
